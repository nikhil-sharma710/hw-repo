## Homework 01: Pushing a Repository and Writing Code in Python

The objective of this project was to both create a repository in the command line and push it to GitHub in order to make a repository for homeworks for the semester and to become familiar with writing code in Python. Two scripts are found in this folder:

* `even_or_odd.py`: randomly generates a list of 10 numbers and states whether each number is even or odd.
* `prime_number.py`: considers all numbers in the range from 3 to 99, inclusive, and only outputs prime numbers.
